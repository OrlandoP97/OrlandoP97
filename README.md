* **Frontend wizardry:** I craft beautiful and functional user interfaces using JavaScript, StencilJS, React, and Angular. I'm all about creating reusable components that make development a breeze.
* **Mobile master:** I build cross-platform mobile apps with Flutter and Firebase. I'm always learning about new frameworks and tools to make my apps even better.
* **Backend buff:** I'm comfortable working with PHP and Drupal to create and maintain content-driven websites. I'm also a fan of Node.js and Express for building APIs.
* **Testing enthusiast:** I'm a big believer in automated testing, and I've got experience with tools like Playwright, Pytest, and Selenium. I'm always looking for ways to improve the quality of my code.

‚òÅÔ∏è Taking to the clouds:
